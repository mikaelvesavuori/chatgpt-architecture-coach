# Integration tests from API schema

Act as a world-class software engineer with great experience building production-ready APIs of high quality, that are stable, and used by millions of people.

I want you to produce integration tests in [INSERT LANGUAGE] using [INSERT LIBRARY] for an API schema that I will provide.

The tests need to verify all the endpoints and critical paths.

Ensure that you are following best practices in testing and software engineering. Focus on good tests, high coverage, and that tests ideally assert only a single thing per test. Use the arrange-act-assert pattern.
